			<title>Payments Plugin</title>
			<link>http://www.sigsiu.net/download/sobi2_plugins/payments_plugin.html</link>
			<description> This backend plugin is made to use within the component SOBI2 (Sigsiu Online Business Index 2). 
 
It allows administrators to view payments that have been done by users on their website. When a user add an entry in the SOBI2 directory and pays for a payable field (ie &quot;description&quot;), it generates a new payment. 
 
It is based upon the sobi2 table &quot;__sobi2_payments&quot; and on the field &quot;payed_date&quot;.
This field is filled when the user goes to pay on paypal. But as there's no feedback payment from paypal, it's not sure that the user really payed. 
 
Therefore, the plugin allows to compare the payments declared on the website by SOBI2 and those received in the Paypal account. 
 
Plugin Features 
 
    * This is a backend plugin 
    * Comes with english and french languages 
    * Displays payments of the day

			<title>Import and Backup Plugin</title>
			<link>http://www.sigsiu.net/download/plugins/import_and_backup.html</link>
			<description> Import   Backup Plugin for Sobi2 to import data, backup your directory, save your configuration or migrate to Sobi2.

 The Import and Backup Plugin for Sobi2 is basically a tool which allows to export and import Sobi2 entries, categories and fields into a CSV file, the most common  export/import file format. This kind of file can easily be edited in spreadsheet programs like OpenOffice or Excel or any other program which is able to read CSV files. 

CSV import allows easy data transfer from another data source in your directory. It is a very time saving tool for each Joomla!/Mambo site using the Sobi2 component the first time.

But this plugin isn't only a simple Import/Export script. The Import and Backup plugin for Sobi2 allows you also to create an internal Sobi2 database backup. This backup can be restored every time with one click. Use this function before you start an import to return easily to the start point, or make a backup before you change Sobi2 settings.

Import and export of Sobi2 categories, including all category images, icons and the category relations.
  
Import and export of Sobi2 entries, including all basic data, custom defined fields content, category relations and logos and icons.
  
Import and export of the Sobi2 fields defined in the Fields Manager, including the basic field definitions and important data.
  
Import and export of the Sobi2 configuration settings. This includes all important Sobi2 settings, the Sobi2 CSS file, the Registry Editor settings (config.ini file) and your customized template files. 
This function is very useful if you upgrade Sobi2. Save and restore these files with one click.

No fixed structure must be observed. Select which information of an entry, category or field you want to import or export. Also the ordering of the fields (spreadsheet columns) can be defined freely. Also basic export information like the CSV value separator and multi-value separator can be adjusted individually.  
The exported data can be cleaned of HTML tags.

You want to import the same data you have exported? Use the copy settings function to copy export settings to import settings, or vice versa.

Because of implementation of a special algorithm it is no problem to import or export data on servers with low memory limit, limited script execution or limited access to MySQL server. No problems like &quot;allowed memory size exhausted&quot;, &quot;MySQL server has gone away&quot; or &quot;maximum execution time of xx seconds exceeded&quot;.

Integrated reporting function. Each import or export operation is logged in a separate logfile where you can investigate if there were some problems during the operation.</description>

			<title>Featured Listings Plugin</title>
			<link>http://www.sigsiu.net/download/plugins/featured_listings.html</link>
			<description> The Featured Listings Plugin shows entries of your Sobi2 directory on a featured position in category view and/or on frontpage of the directory, using a self-definable 'featured' layout.

 Offer your customers the possibility to show their entries on a featured position above the standard listings. For that, choose other colors or a different presentation to be in contrast to the normal listings.


Show the featured entries for a certain time period. At the end of this time period the entry will be removed from featured position automatically.

Choose a number of impressions for the featured entries. If the entries are shown appropriate often they will be removed from featured position automatically.

Offer your customers the possibility to show their entries on a featured position as long as a certain number of Clicks (Hits) through the details view of the entry isn't reached. After that the entry will be removed from featured position automatically.

Of course an entry can be shown at featured position permanently without expiration.

Distinguish between the presentation at featured position within the category view of your directory or the presentation on the frontpage of your directory. 
The number of featured listings on frontpage can be limited and shown randomly.

Because of the unlimited number of scenarios of supply you can offer your customers different proposals. Thus for example, your product line can contain an inexpensive offer with a display time of 10 days and a premium offer with a display time of a year.

Using the additional module the featured listings can be shown again elsewhere on your site.

You will get free updates of the product, access to the documentation and web-based support in our Support Center within your support and documentation subscription period of 12 months after purchase date.</description>
